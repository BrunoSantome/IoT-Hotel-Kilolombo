# IoT-Hotel-Kilolombo
The hotel kilombo is a project where  we can control several rooms of a hotel through a website that uses the MQTT protocol to comunicate. The project is constructed with dockers, uses the mariaDB database to store all the information and also implements a raspberry to simultate the behaviour of each room. 

The raspberry simulates a real phisical room with different components, to create the other rooms of the hotel we use the digitalTwin to create "X" copies. The website can fully control all rooms and connects also with the mariaDB database.
