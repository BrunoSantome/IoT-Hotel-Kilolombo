# IoT-Hotel-Kilolombo
The hotel kilombo is a project where  we can control several rooms of a hotel through a website that uses the MQTT protocol to comunicate. The project is constructed with dockers, uses the mariaDB database to store all the information and also implements a raspberry to simultate the behaviour of each room.
